![Agent Flow Architecture](images/agent-flow-diagram.png)
_Sequential agent workflow showing the complete recipe discovery process_

The application uses a sequential agent pattern in Flowise:

1. **Start Node** ‚Üí **Recipe Finder Agent** ‚Üí **Recipe Pruner Agent** ‚Üí **End Node**

### Agent Workflow:

1. **Recipe Finder Agent**: Takes user criteria and searches Spoonacular API for matching recipes
2. **Recipe Pruner Agent**: Analyzes the results and returns the 5 best recipes in a structured format

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)

   ```bash
   # Check your Node.js version
   node --version
   ```

2. **Flowise** - Install globally
   ```bash
   npm install -g flowise
   ```
   Or using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker pull flowiseai/flowise
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables (REQUIRED BEFORE STARTING FLOWISE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Configure environment variables BEFORE starting Flowise**

1. Copy the environment template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your actual API keys:

   ```bash
   # Open .env in your preferred editor
   nano .env
   # or
   code .env
   ```

3. Add your actual API keys to the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   # .env file (this file is gitignored for security)
   SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_actual_spoonacular_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key_here
   ```

4. **Verify your environment file**:
   ```bash
   # Check that your .env file exists and has the correct content
   cat .env
   ```

![Environment Setup](images/env-setup.png)
_Setting up secure environment variables_

### Step 3: Start Flowise with Environment Variables

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Flowise must be started with environment variables loaded**

**Method A: Load environment variables and start Flowise (Recommended)**

```bash
# Load environment variables from .env file and start Flowise
export $(cat .env | xargs) && npx flowise start

# Verify variables are loaded before starting
echo "Spoonacular API Key: $SPOONACULAR_API_KEY"
echo "OpenAI API Key: $OPENAI_API_KEY"
npx flowise start
```

**Method B: Using Docker with environment file**

```bash
# Using Docker with environment file (Recommended for Docker users)
docker run -d \
  --name flowise \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file .env \
  flowiseai/flowise

# Or with individual environment variables
docker run -d \
  --name flowise \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e SPOONACULAR_API_KEY="$(grep SPOONACULAR_API_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2)" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$(grep OPENAI_API_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2)" \
  flowiseai/flowise
```

**Method C: Manual export (Alternative)**

```bash
# Export variables manually
export SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_actual_spoonacular_key_here
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key_here

# Then start Flowise
npx flowise start
```

Flowise will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 4: Verify Environment Variables in Flowise

Before importing tools, verify that Flowise can access your environment variables:

1. Check Flowise logs for environment variable loading
2. In Flowise, you can test environment variable access in custom tools
3. Ensure no errors related to missing environment variables

### Step 5: Import Custom Tool

Before configuring API keys, you need to import the Spoonacular tool:

1. In Flowise dashboard, navigate to **Tools** section
2. Click **"Import Tool"** or **"Add Tool"**
3. Upload the `tools/spoonacular_recipe_finder-CustomTool.json` file
4. Save the imported tool

### Step 5: Configure API Keys in Tools

#### Configure Spoonacular API Key:

**Option A: Using Environment Variables (Recommended - if Flowise supports process.env)**

1. After importing the tool, edit the **spoonacular_recipe_finder** tool
2. In the **Function** section, update to use environment variables:

   ```javascript
   const fetch = require("node-fetch");

   async function fetchRecipe() {
     // Try to get API key from environment variable first
     const apiKey =
       process.env.SPOONACULAR_API_KEY || "YOUR_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY_HERE";

     if (!apiKey || apiKey === "YOUR_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY_HERE") {
       throw new Error(
         "SPOONACULAR_API_KEY environment variable not set. Please configure your API key."
       );
     }

     const url = `https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/findByIngredients?apiKey=${apiKey}&number=20&ingredients=${$ingredients}`;

     try {
       const response = await fetch(url);
       const data = await response.json();

       console.log("Recipe:", data[0]);
       return JSON.stringify(data);
     } catch (error) {
       return "Error fetching recipe: " + error;
     }
   }

   return fetchRecipe();
   ```

3. Save the tool configuration

**Option B: Direct Configuration (If environment variables don't work in Flowise)**

1. Replace the API key directly in the function:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = "your_actual_spoonacular_key_here";
   ```
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Risk**: Remember to remove the key before committing to version control

**Option C: Flowise Credentials (Most Secure for Production)**

1. Use Flowise's built-in credential management system
2. Create a credential in Flowise settings
3. Reference the credential in your tool function

     # Check current environment
     env | grep -E "(SPOONACULAR|OPENAI)"

     # Reload and restart
     source .env
     npx flowise start
     ```

   - For Docker, ensure `--env-file .env` is used
   - Check Flowise logs for environment-related errors

4. **Flow Execution Errors**
   - Check all nodes are properly connected
   - Verify agent memory is configured if using stateful conversations
