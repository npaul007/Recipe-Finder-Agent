# Recipe Finder Agent üç≥ü§ñ

A sophisticated AI-powered recipe discovery application built with Flowise that helps users find personalized meal recipes based on their preferences, dietary restrictions, and health goals. This project demonstrates advanced AI agent orchestration using sequential agents and external API integration.

## üåü Features

- **Intelligent Recipe Discovery**: Uses the Spoonacular API to find recipes based on preferred ingredients
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Sequential agent workflow with specialized roles:
  - **Recipe Finder Agent**: Searches for recipes using specified ingredients
  - **Recipe Pruner Agent**: Filters and formats recipes based on dietary criteria
- **Personalized Filtering**: Considers user's favorite foods, allergies, and dietary goals
- **Structured JSON Output**: Returns clean, formatted recipe data with ingredients, directions, and images
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent recipe curation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![Agent Flow Architecture](images/agent-flow-diagram.png)
_Sequential agent workflow showing the complete recipe discovery process_

The application uses a sequential agent pattern in Flowise:

1. **Start Node** ‚Üí **Recipe Finder Agent** ‚Üí **Recipe Pruner Agent** ‚Üí **End Node**

### Agent Workflow:

1. **Recipe Finder Agent**: Takes user criteria and searches Spoonacular API for matching recipes
2. **Recipe Pruner Agent**: Analyzes the results and returns the 5 best recipes in a structured format

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)

   ```bash
   # Check your Node.js version
   node --version
   ```

2. **Flowise** - Install globally
   ```bash
   npm install -g flowise
   ```
   Or using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker pull flowiseai/flowise
   ```

### Required API Keys

#### 1. Spoonacular API Key

- Visit [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
- Sign up for a free account
- Navigate to your profile and copy your API key
- **Important**: Replace the API key in the custom tool configuration

#### 2. OpenAI API Key (or Alternative LLM)

- Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Alternative LLM options:
  - **Anthropic Claude**: [Get API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
  - **Google Gemini**: [Get API key](https://ai.google.dev/)
  - **Local LLMs**: Ollama, LM Studio, or similar
  - **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise option

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Recipe-Finder-Agent.git
cd Recipe-Finder-Agent
```

### Step 2: Start Flowise

```bash
# Using npm installation
npx flowise start

# Or using Docker
docker run -d --name flowise -p 3000:3000 flowiseai/flowise
```

Flowise will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Import Custom Tool

Before configuring API keys, you need to import the Spoonacular tool:

1. In Flowise dashboard, navigate to **Tools** section
2. Click **"Import Tool"** or **"Add Tool"**
3. Upload the `tools/spoonacular_recipe_finder-CustomTool.json` file
4. Save the imported tool

### Step 4: Configure API Keys

#### Configure Spoonacular API Key:

1. After importing the tool, edit the **spoonacular_recipe_finder** tool
2. In the **Function** section, replace the existing API key:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = "YOUR_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY_HERE";
   ```
3. Save the tool configuration

#### Configure OpenAI Credentials in Flowise:

1. Navigate to Flowise dashboard (`http://localhost:3000`)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Credentials**
3. Add new credential with type **OpenAI API**
4. Enter your OpenAI API key

### Step 5: Import the Agent Flow

1. In Flowise dashboard, click **"Import Chatflow"**
2. Upload the `agent/Recipe Finder Agent Agents.json` file
3. The chatflow will be imported with all agent configurations

### Step 6: Link the Custom Tool

1. Open the imported chatflow
2. Ensure the **Custom Tool** node is linked to the **Recipe Finder Agent**
3. In the Custom Tool node, select the imported **spoonacular_recipe_finder** tool
4. Verify all connections between nodes are intact

## üéØ Usage

![Usage Example](images/usage-example.png)
_Example conversation with the Recipe Finder Agent_

### Example Query Format:

```
I love chicken, broccoli, and rice. I'm allergic to nuts and dairy.
I want to build muscle and eat high-protein meals.
```

### Expected Response:

The agent will return a JSON object with 5 curated recipes:

```json
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "name": "High-Protein Chicken and Broccoli Bowl",
      "description": "A nutritious muscle-building meal with lean protein and vegetables",
      "directions": [
        "Season chicken breast with salt and pepper",
        "Heat oil in pan and cook chicken until golden",
        "Steam broccoli until tender",
        "Serve over cooked rice"
      ],
      "ingredients": [
        "1 lb chicken breast",
        "2 cups broccoli florets",
        "1 cup brown rice",
        "2 tbsp olive oil"
      ],
      "imageUrls": "https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Common Issues:

1. **API Key Errors**

   - Verify Spoonacular API key is valid and has available requests
   - Check OpenAI API key has sufficient credits

2. **Tool Not Found**

   - Ensure custom tool is properly imported and linked to the agent
   - Verify tool ID matches in the agent configuration

3. **Flow Execution Errors**
   - Check all nodes are properly connected
   - Verify agent memory is configured if using stateful conversations

### Debug Mode:

Enable debug logging in Flowise settings to see detailed execution logs.

## üìä API Limits

- **Spoonacular Free Tier**: 150 requests/day
- **OpenAI Rates**: Vary by model and tier

Monitor your usage to avoid hitting rate limits.
